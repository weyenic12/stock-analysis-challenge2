# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

- The purpose of our analysis is to analyze the dozen stocks that Steve wanted to research for his parents. These 12 stocks had data from the years 2017 and 2018. For the challenge, we had to refactor the code to make it run faster and overall be more efficient.

## Results

- By looking at the [code](/Resources/code.png). We can see the added code for the for loops and how we were able to make it cleaner and more efficient.
- We can also look at the three pictures listed below to analyze the the difference in execution times. As you can see, the refactored code for the 2017 and 2018 years was ran in around 0.11-0.12 seconds. If you look at the 2018 original code, it would take around 0.6 seconds to run. This is a big difference and will make a big difference when analyzing more stocks.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- There are many advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code. In my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. For example, some advantages of refactoring code include readability and efficiency. Refactoring helps clean up the code to make it organized. You end up with a product that is more clear than it was before and more efficient. Some disadvantages to refactoring code is that you could be spending a lot of time on it, just to end up with a slightly improved product. It may not be worth it if it too long to do or it could be difficult to do and you get lost while trying to refactor.

### How they apply to the original VBA script

- In this case, the advantages of refactoring the code are much better than the disadvantages. We can speed up the macro run time from 0.6 to 0.1 seconds and we can make the program's code more organized and understandable. With this script it does not take that much time to refactor the code. However for other scripts, where there is a lot more code and the script is much bigger, it may not be worth the time investment.
