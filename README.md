# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

- The purpose of our analysis is to analyze the dozen stocks that Steve wanted to research for his parents. These 12 stocks had data from the years 2017 and 2018. For the challenge, we had to refactor the code to make it run faster and overall be more efficient.

## Results

- By looking at the [code](/Resources/code.png). We can see the added code for the for loops and how we were able to make it cleaner and more efficient.
- We can also look at the three pictures listed below to analyze the the difference in execution times. As you can see, the refactored code for the 2017 and 2018 years was ran in around 0.11-0.12 seconds. If you look at the 2018 original code, it would take around 0.6 seconds to run. This is a big difference and will make a big difference when analyzing more stocks.
